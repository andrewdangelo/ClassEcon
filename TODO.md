# ClassEcon TODO List

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Student Payment Request Page - Reasons Not Loading
- **Issue**: Students cannot see fine reasons in the dropdown on the payment request page
- **Status**: âœ… Fixed
- **Root Cause**: Backend resolver `reasonsByClass` was using `requireClassTeacher()` which only allowed teachers to query reasons, blocking students from accessing them
- **Solution**: Changed the resolver to use `requireAuth()` instead, allowing authenticated students to view reasons while still protecting the data
- **Details**: 
  - Teachers can add fine reasons in the class management page
  - Cache invalidation has been implemented with `refetchQueries` for `REASONS_BY_CLASS` query
  - Students can now query reasons to populate the dropdown
- **Components Affected**:
  - âœ… `Backend/src/resolvers/Query.ts` - Changed auth requirement from teacher-only to authenticated users

### 2. Data Persistence Issues on Page Reload
- **Issue**: Dashboard, Requests, and Store pages don't maintain their data on reload
- **Status**: âœ… Fixed
- **Root Causes Found**:
  1. Redux state (accessToken, user) was not persisted to storage - lost on reload
  2. ProtectedRoute didn't update Redux when ME query succeeded with refresh token
  3. Apollo cache wasn't optimally configured for list merging
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  1. âœ… Updated `ProtectedRoute.tsx` to dispatch user data to Redux when ME query succeeds on reload
  2. âœ… Enhanced Apollo Client cache with proper merge policies for all query fields
  3. âœ… Verified all affected pages use `cache-and-network` fetch policy
- **Pages Verified**:
  - âœ… Dashboard page (already using cache-and-network)
  - âœ… Requests page (already using cache-and-network)  
  - âœ… Store page (uses useApi hook with proper caching)
- **How It Works Now**:
  - On page reload, ProtectedRoute makes ME query using refresh token cookie
  - When ME query succeeds, user data is stored in Redux for app-wide access
  - Apollo cache retains query results and merges updates properly
  - Pages can show cached data instantly while fetching fresh data in background

## Additional Notes

- **Cache Invalidation**: Recently implemented `refetchQueries` for fine reasons synchronization
- **Authentication**: May need to review auth token persistence and user context restoration
- **Apollo Client**: Consider implementing cache persistence or adjusting fetchPolicy for better user experience

## New Issues - October 7, 2025, 11:30 PM

### 1. Notification Modal Empty Issue
- **Issue**: When a notification comes through, nothing populates the notification modal even though there is a notification indicator
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ Open
- **Priority**: High
- **Details**: 
  - Notification bell shows unread count
  - Clicking bell opens modal but no notifications are displayed
  - Need to investigate notification query and rendering logic
- **Components to Check**:
  - `Frontend/src/components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx`
  - `Frontend/src/graphql/queries/notifications.ts`
  - Backend notification resolvers

### 2. Purchase Transaction Validation Error
- **Issue**: Purchase fails with validation error even when student has sufficient funds
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ Open
- **Priority**: High
- **Error Message**: "Purchase failed - Transaction validation failed: amount: Path `amount` (-10) is less than minimum allowed value (0)."
- **Details**:
  - Student has enough funds but purchase is rejected
  - Transaction model validation is treating negative amount (debit) as invalid
  - Need to allow negative amounts for purchases/debits
- **Root Cause**: Transaction model may have min: 0 validation on amount field
- **Components to Check**:
  - `Backend/src/models/Transaction.ts` - Check amount field validation
  - Purchase mutation resolver - Ensure amount is being set correctly (should be negative for debits)

### 3. Double Payment Investigation
- **Issue**: When a teacher pays out a student, the amount might be getting doubled
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ Open
- **Priority**: High
- **Details**:
  - Need to verify payment logic to ensure amount isn't being applied twice
  - Check if payment creates multiple transactions
- **Components to Check**:
  - `Backend/src/resolvers/Mutation.ts` - payRequest mutation
  - Account balance update logic
  - Transaction creation for payments

### 4. Student Purchase History & Backpack Feature
- **Feature Request**: Comprehensive purchase tracking and redemption system
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ Open
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Requirements**:
  1. **Student "Backpack" Feature**:
     - Purchased items go into student's "Backpack"
     - Backpack shown in sidebar
     - Students can view their purchased items
  
  2. **Item Redemption System**:
     - Student clicks "Redeem" on an item in their backpack
     - Creates a redemption request that requires teacher approval
     - Teacher must comment on what the item was used for (history tracking)
     - Once approved, item is removed from backpack and marked as redeemed
  
  3. **History Tracking**:
     - Both students and teachers can view purchase/redemption history
     - Teachers can view inside any student's backpack
     - Teachers have a dedicated page showing all redemption requests
     - Redemption page organized by class and student
  
  4. **Implementation Tasks**:
     - [ ] Create `PurchasedItem` model with fields: studentId, itemId, purchaseDate, status (in-backpack, redeemed, expired), redemptionDate, redemptionNote
     - [ ] Create `RedemptionRequest` model with fields: purchasedItemId, studentId, requestDate, status (pending, approved, denied), teacherComment
     - [ ] Add GraphQL schema for PurchasedItem and RedemptionRequest
     - [ ] Create mutations: createRedemptionRequest, approveRedemption, denyRedemption
     - [ ] Create queries: studentBackpack, redemptionRequests (for teachers), purchaseHistory
     - [ ] Build Backpack component for sidebar
     - [ ] Build redemption request UI for students
     - [ ] Build teacher redemption approval page
     - [ ] Add purchase history view for both roles
