# ClassEcon TODO List

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Student Payment Request Page - Reasons Not Loading
- **Issue**: Students cannot see fine reasons in the dropdown on the payment request page
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Root Cause**: Backend resolver `reasonsByClass` was using `requireClassTeacher()` which only allowed teachers to query reasons, blocking students from accessing them
- **Solution**: Changed the resolver to use `requireAuth()` instead, allowing authenticated students to view reasons while still protecting the data
- **Details**: 
  - Teachers can add fine reasons in the class management page
  - Cache invalidation has been implemented with `refetchQueries` for `REASONS_BY_CLASS` query
  - Students can now query reasons to populate the dropdown
- **Components Affected**:
  - ‚úÖ `Backend/src/resolvers/Query.ts` - Changed auth requirement from teacher-only to authenticated users

### 2. Data Persistence Issues on Page Reload
- **Issue**: Dashboard, Requests, and Store pages don't maintain their data on reload
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Root Causes Found**:
  1. Redux state (accessToken, user) was not persisted to storage - lost on reload
  2. ProtectedRoute didn't update Redux when ME query succeeded with refresh token
  3. Apollo cache wasn't optimally configured for list merging
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  1. ‚úÖ Updated `ProtectedRoute.tsx` to dispatch user data to Redux when ME query succeeds on reload
  2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Apollo Client cache with proper merge policies for all query fields
  3. ‚úÖ Verified all affected pages use `cache-and-network` fetch policy
- **Pages Verified**:
  - ‚úÖ Dashboard page (already using cache-and-network)
  - ‚úÖ Requests page (already using cache-and-network)  
  - ‚úÖ Store page (uses useApi hook with proper caching)
- **How It Works Now**:
  - On page reload, ProtectedRoute makes ME query using refresh token cookie
  - When ME query succeeds, user data is stored in Redux for app-wide access
  - Apollo cache retains query results and merges updates properly
  - Pages can show cached data instantly while fetching fresh data in background

## Additional Notes

- **Cache Invalidation**: Recently implemented `refetchQueries` for fine reasons synchronization
- **Authentication**: May need to review auth token persistence and user context restoration
- **Apollo Client**: Consider implementing cache persistence or adjusting fetchPolicy for better user experience

## New Issues - October 7, 2025, 11:30 PM

### 1. Notification Modal Empty Issue
- **Issue**: When a notification comes through, nothing populates the notification modal even though there is a notification indicator
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Priority**: High
- **Root Cause**: Missing `Notification` resolver in backend - GraphQL couldn't map MongoDB's `_id` to GraphQL's `id` field
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  1. ‚úÖ Added `Notification: { id: pickId }` to backend resolvers - **THIS WAS THE KEY FIX**
  2. ‚úÖ Fixed subscription resolver to handle undefined payloads properly
  3. ‚úÖ Added Apollo cache policies (Notification type policy and notifications merge policy)
  4. ‚úÖ Updated mutations with refetchQueries
- **Details**: 
  - Backend query was returning 4 notifications from MongoDB
  - But GraphQL couldn't serialize them because `_id` wasn't mapped to `id`
  - Frontend expected `id` field but was getting `_id`, causing the data to be unusable
  - All other models had `id: pickId` resolver but Notification was missing
- **Files Modified**:
  - `Backend/src/resolvers/index.ts` - **Added Notification: { id: pickId }** ‚≠ê MAIN FIX
  - `Backend/src/resolvers/Subscription.ts` - Fixed undefined payload handling
  - `Frontend/src/graphql/client.ts` - Cache policies
  - `Frontend/src/components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx` - Debugging & error states
  - `Backend/src/resolvers/Query.ts` - Debug logging (can be removed)
  - `Frontend/src/graphql/links.ts` - Error logging

### 2. Purchase Transaction Validation Error
- **Issue**: Purchase fails with validation error even when student has sufficient funds
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Priority**: High
- **Error Message**: "Purchase failed - Transaction validation failed: amount: Path `amount` (-10) is less than minimum allowed value (0)."
- **Root Cause**: Transaction model had `min: 0` validation on amount field, preventing negative amounts needed for debits/purchases
- **Solution**: Removed the `min: 0` validation constraint to allow negative amounts for debits (purchases, fines, etc.)
- **Details**:
  - Transaction amounts can now be negative (debits) or positive (credits)
  - Purchases correctly create negative transactions to deduct from student balance
  - The purchase mutation logic was correct - it was just the model validation blocking it
- **Files Modified**:
  - `Backend/src/models/Transaction.ts` - Removed `min: 0` validation from amount field ‚≠ê MAIN FIX

### 3. Double Payment Investigation
- **Issue**: When a teacher pays out a student, the amount might be getting doubled
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Priority**: High
- **Root Cause**: Both `approvePayRequest` AND `submitPayRequest` were creating transactions, causing double payment
- **Solution**: Removed transaction creation from `approvePayRequest` - only `submitPayRequest` creates the transaction now
- **Details**:
  - **Previous Flow (BROKEN)**:
    1. Teacher approves request ‚Üí `approvePayRequest` creates PAYROLL transaction with amount
    2. Teacher/system pays request ‚Üí `submitPayRequest` creates ANOTHER transaction with amount
    3. Result: Amount is added to student balance TWICE üí•
  - **New Flow (FIXED)**:
    1. Teacher approves request ‚Üí `approvePayRequest` just updates status to "APPROVED" and stores approved amount
    2. Teacher/system pays request ‚Üí `submitPayRequest` creates ONE transaction with the approved amount
    3. Result: Amount is added to student balance ONCE ‚úÖ
  - The approve step is now just an approval/review step, not a payment step
  - Actual payment only happens when `submitPayRequest` is called
- **Files Modified**:
  - `Backend/src/resolvers/Mutation.ts` - Removed transaction creation from `approvePayRequest` ‚≠ê MAIN FIX

### 4. Student Purchase History & Backpack Feature
- **Feature Request**: Comprehensive purchase tracking and redemption system
- **Status**: ÔøΩ In Progress - Backend Complete, Frontend Needed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Backend Implementation**: ‚úÖ Complete
  
  **Completed Tasks**:
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced `Purchase` model with status tracking (in-backpack, redeemed, expired)
  - ‚úÖ Created `RedemptionRequest` model with all required fields
  - ‚úÖ Added GraphQL schema types: `Purchase` (enhanced), `RedemptionRequest`
  - ‚úÖ Added GraphQL enums: `PurchaseStatus`, `RedemptionStatus`
  - ‚úÖ Implemented mutations:
    - `createRedemptionRequest(purchaseId, studentNote)` - Student requests to redeem item
    - `approveRedemption(id, teacherComment)` - Teacher approves and marks item as redeemed
    - `denyRedemption(id, teacherComment)` - Teacher denies redemption request
  - ‚úÖ Implemented queries:
    - `studentBackpack(studentId, classId)` - Get items in student's backpack
    - `purchaseHistory(studentId, classId)` - Full purchase history with all statuses
    - `redemptionRequests(classId, status)` - Teacher views redemption requests
    - `redemptionRequest(id)` - Get single redemption request details
  - ‚úÖ Added field resolvers for nested data (storeItem, purchase, student, reviewedBy)
  - ‚úÖ Proper authorization checks (students can only access their own data, teachers can access their class)
  
  **How It Works**:
  1. Student makes purchase ‚Üí Status: "in-backpack"
  2. Student creates redemption request ‚Üí Status remains "in-backpack", request: "pending"
  3. Teacher approves ‚Üí Purchase status: "redeemed", redemption date & note saved
  4. Teacher denies ‚Üí Purchase stays "in-backpack", student can request again later
  
  **Frontend Tasks Remaining**:
  - [ ] Run `pnpm codegen` to generate TypeScript types from new schema
  - [ ] Build Backpack component for sidebar (shows in-backpack items with redeem button)
  - [ ] Build redemption request UI for students (view pending/approved/denied requests)
  - [ ] Build teacher redemption approval page (list of pending requests by class)
  - [ ] Add purchase history view for both students and teachers
  - [ ] Create GraphQL queries/mutations in Frontend
  - [ ] Add navigation links to new pages
  
  **Files Created/Modified**:
  - Backend:
    - `Backend/src/models/Purchase.ts` - Added status, redemptionDate, redemptionNote
    - `Backend/src/models/RedemptionRequest.ts` - New model (created)
    - `Backend/src/models/index.ts` - Export new model
    - `Backend/src/schema.ts` - Added types, enums, queries, mutations
    - `Backend/src/resolvers/Query.ts` - Added 4 new query resolvers
    - `Backend/src/resolvers/Mutation.ts` - Added 3 new mutation resolvers
    - `Backend/src/resolvers/index.ts` - Added field resolvers
  - Frontend: (To be implemented)
