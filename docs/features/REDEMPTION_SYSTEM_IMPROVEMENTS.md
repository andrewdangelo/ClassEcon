# Redemption System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the redemption system to enhance tracking, auditing, and user experience.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Unique Item IDs for Purchases
**Purpose**: Enable better tracking and auditing of individual purchases

**Backend Changes:**
- **File**: `Backend/src/models/Purchase.ts`
  - Added `itemId` field to Purchase interface and schema
  - Auto-generates unique ID in format: `ITEM-{timestamp}-{random}`
  - Field is unique and indexed for fast lookups
  
- **File**: `Backend/src/schema.ts`
  - Added `itemId: String!` to Purchase type

**Frontend Changes:**
- **Files**: Updated all GraphQL queries to include `itemId` field
  - `Frontend/src/graphql/queries/backpack.ts`
  - All Purchase queries now fetch itemId

**Benefits:**
- Each purchase has a unique, human-readable identifier
- Easier to correlate items across history and audit logs
- Helps track specific items through their lifecycle

### 2. Required Student Note for Redemption Requests
**Purpose**: Ensure students provide context for how they intend to use redeemable items

**Backend Changes:**
- **File**: `Backend/src/schema.ts`
  - Changed `createRedemptionRequest` mutation parameter from `studentNote: String` to `studentNote: String!` (required)

- **File**: `Backend/src/resolvers/Mutation.ts`
  - Updated `createRedemptionRequest` function signature to require `studentNote`
  - Added validation to ensure note is not empty or whitespace
  - Returns helpful error message if validation fails

**Frontend Changes:**
- **File**: `Frontend/src/graphql/mutations/redemption.ts`
  - Updated `CREATE_REDEMPTION_REQUEST` mutation to require `studentNote`

- **File**: `Frontend/src/modules/students/BackpackPage.tsx`
  - Changed input from single-line to multi-line Textarea
  - Added character counter
  - Added alert message explaining requirement
  - Submit button disabled until note is provided
  - Better placeholder text with example
  - Shows error messages from backend

**Benefits:**
- Teachers have context for each redemption request
- Prevents accidental submissions
- Encourages thoughtful use of rewards
- Creates better record for auditing

---

### 3. Redemption History Tracking
**Purpose**: Allow students and teachers to view complete history of redemption attempts

**Backend Changes:**
- **File**: `Backend/src/schema.ts`
  - Added new query: `redemptionHistory(studentId: ID!, classId: ID!): [RedemptionRequest!]!`

- **File**: `Backend/src/resolvers/Query.ts`
  - Implemented `redemptionHistory` query
  - Returns all redemption requests for a student in a class (approved, denied, pending)
  - Sorted by creation date (newest first)
  - Includes proper authorization checks

**Frontend Changes:**
- **File**: `Frontend/src/graphql/queries/backpack.ts`
  - Added `REDEMPTION_HISTORY` query with full details
  - Fetches purchase info, item details, and teacher responses

- **File**: `Frontend/src/modules/students/BackpackPage.tsx`
  - Added tabbed interface with "Active Items" and "Redemption History"
  - History tab shows:
    - All redemption attempts (approved, denied, pending)
    - Item ID for reference
    - Request and review timestamps
    - Student's original note
    - Teacher's response/comment
    - Reviewer name
    - Status badges with appropriate colors
  - Visual separation between active and historical items

- **File**: `Frontend/src/modules/requests/RedemptionRequestsPage.tsx`
  - Added itemId display for teacher reference

**Benefits:**
- Complete audit trail of all redemption activity
- Students can reference denied requests and resubmit with improvements
- Teachers can see patterns in student requests
- Transparent communication between teachers and students

### 4. Improved Status Handling
**How it works:**

#### Approved Redemptions:
1. Purchase status changes from "in-backpack" to "redeemed"
2. Purchase gains `redemptionDate` and `redemptionNote` (teacher's comment)
3. Item removed from "Active Items" in student's backpack
4. Appears in "Redemption History" with approved status
5. Shows approval date and teacher comment

#### Denied Redemptions:
1. Purchase remains in "in-backpack" status
2. Item stays in "Active Items" (can be requested again)
3. Appears in "Redemption History" with denied status
4. Shows denial date and teacher's explanation
5. Student can submit a new request with improved justification

#### Pending Redemptions:
1. Purchase status remains "in-backpack"
2. Item shows "Request Pending" badge in Active Items
3. Submit button disabled until teacher reviews
4. Also visible in Redemption History

**Benefits:**
- Clear item lifecycle management
- Students retain items when denied
- Transparency in decision-making
- Opportunity for students to improve requests

---

### 5. UI/UX Improvements

**Student Backpack Page:**
- Tabbed interface for better organization
- Badge counters showing number of active items and history entries
- Clear visual status indicators
- Detailed history cards with all relevant information
- Improved dialog with better instructions
- Character counter for notes
- Alert component for important messages

**Teacher Redemption Page:**
- Now displays itemId for reference
- Better organized card layout
- Clear status badges

**New Components:**
- Created `Frontend/src/components/ui/alert.tsx` for important messages

---

## Database Schema Updates

### Purchase Model
```typescript
interface IPurchase {
  itemId: string;  // NEW: Unique identifier
  // ... other fields
}
```

### RedemptionRequest Flow
1. Student creates request with required note
2. Teacher reviews with context from note
3. Approval → Item moves to history as "redeemed"
4. Denial → Item remains active, history shows denial
5. All attempts tracked in redemption history

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Required Note:**
   - Try submitting redemption without note (should fail)
   - Try submitting with only whitespace (should fail)
   - Submit with valid note (should succeed)

2. **Test History:**
   - Create multiple redemption requests
   - Approve some, deny others
   - Verify all show in history tab
   - Check denied items still appear in active items

3. **Test Item IDs:**
   - Create new purchases
   - Verify unique itemId is generated
   - Track itemId through redemption process

4. **Test Teacher View:**
   - Verify itemId displays on redemption cards
   - Check teacher can see student notes
   - Confirm teacher comments appear in student history

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Search/filter history by date range or status
- Export history to CSV for record-keeping
- Notification when redemption is reviewed
- Analytics on redemption patterns
- Bulk operations for teachers
- Redemption request limits (e.g., one pending per item)
