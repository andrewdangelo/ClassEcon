## 🔧 How It Works

### Issuing a Fine (Teacher)

```
1. Teacher opens "Issue Fine" dialog
2. Selects student from dropdown
3. Enters amount (must be > 0)
4. Enters reason (required)
5. Optionally adds description
6. Clicks "Issue Fine"

Backend Process:
→ Validates teacher has class access
→ Creates Fine record (status: APPLIED)
→ Creates Transaction (type: FINE, amount: -50)
→ Links transaction to fine
→ Sends notification to student
→ Returns fine object

Student Impact:
→ Balance reduced by fine amount
→ Receives notification
→ Fine appears in "My Fines" list
→ Transaction appears in history
```

### Waiving a Fine (Teacher)

```
1. Teacher finds fine in management page
2. Clicks "Waive" button
3. Enters required reason
4. Confirms

Backend Process:
→ Updates fine status to WAIVED
→ Stores waive reason, date, and teacher
→ Creates Transaction (type: REFUND, amount: +50)
→ Sends notification to student
→ Returns updated fine

Student Impact:
→ Balance increased by refunded amount
→ Receives waive notification
→ Fine marked as waived in list
→ Refund appears in transaction history
```

### Viewing Fines

**Teacher View:**
- Access: `/classes/:classId/fines` (or Fines Management page)
- Shows all fines in the class
- Filters: All, Applied, Waived
- Actions: Issue Fine, Waive Fine
- Details: Student, Amount, Reason, Status, Date, Teacher

**Student View:**
- Access: Student Dashboard or Profile
- Component: `<StudentFinesList studentId={id} classId={id} />`
- Shows only student's fines
- Active fines alert at top
- Status badges for Applied/Waived
- Full reason and description display

## 🔌 Integration Guide

### Add Fines to Teacher Dashboard

```tsx
import { FinesManagementPage } from "@/modules/fines/FinesManagementPage";

// Add route
<Route path="/classes/:classId/fines" element={<FinesManagementPage />} />

// Add navigation button
<Button onClick={() => navigate(`/classes/${classId}/fines`)}>
  <DollarSign className="mr-2" />
  Manage Fines
</Button>
```

### Add Fines to Student Profile/Dashboard

```tsx
import { StudentFinesList } from "@/components/fines/StudentFinesList";

// In student profile or dashboard
<StudentFinesList studentId={studentId} classId={classId} />
```

### Add "Issue Fine" Button to Student Detail Page

```tsx
import { IssueFineDialog } from "@/components/fines/IssueFineDialog";

// In StudentDetail.tsx
const [showFineDialog, setShowFineDialog] = useState(false);

<Button onClick={() => setShowFineDialog(true)}>
  <AlertTriangle className="mr-2" />
  Issue Fine
</Button>

<IssueFineDialog
  open={showFineDialog}
  onOpenChange={setShowFineDialog}
  classId={classId}
  preselectedStudentId={studentId}
/>
```

## 📊 Database Schema

```typescript
Fine {
  _id: ObjectId
  studentId: ObjectId → User
  classId: ObjectId → Class
  teacherId: ObjectId → User
  amount: Number (positive, e.g., 50)
  reason: String (required, max 100 chars)
  description: String (optional, max 500 chars)
  transactionId: ObjectId → Transaction
  status: "PENDING" | "APPLIED" | "WAIVED"
  waivedReason: String
  waivedAt: Date
  waivedByUserId: ObjectId → User
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

Transaction (when fine issued) {
  type: "FINE"
  amount: -50  // Negative = debit
  memo: "Fine: Disrupting class"
}

Transaction (when fine waived) {
  type: "REFUND"
  amount: 50   // Positive = credit
  memo: "Fine waived: Disrupting class"
}
```
