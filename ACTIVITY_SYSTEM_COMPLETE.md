# Student Activity System - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Built

I've successfully transformed the student dashboard by replacing the "My Fines" widget with a comprehensive **Activity System** that provides students with a complete view of their financial transactions.

## Summary of Changes

### 🎯 Three Main Components Created

1. **StudentActivityWidget** - Dashboard widget showing last 5 transactions with filtering
2. **BalanceOverTimeChart** - SVG chart visualizing balance history over time
3. **MyActivityPage** - Full-page transaction history viewer with advanced filtering and export

### 📝 Files Modified

1. **StudentDashboard.tsx** - Added balance chart at top, replaced fines widget with activity widget
2. **StudentLayout.tsx** - Replaced "My Fines" link with "My Activity" link in sidebar
3. **main.tsx** - Added route for My Activity page

## Key Features

### 📊 Balance Visualization
- **SVG line chart** showing balance progression over time
- **Statistics**: Highest balance, lowest balance, total transactions
- **Visual indicators**: Change amount with up/down arrows
- **Responsive design**: Scales perfectly on all screen sizes

### 🔍 Transaction Filtering
- **By Type**: All types, Deposits, Income, Payroll, Purchases, Fines, Refunds, Expenses
- **By Date**: All time, This month, Last month, Last 3 months
- **By Search**: Text search through transaction memos and types
- **Combined**: All filters work together

### 📈 Statistics Dashboard
- **Total Income**: Sum of all positive transactions (green)
- **Total Expenses**: Sum of all negative transactions (red)
- **Net Change**: Overall change in balance
- **Transaction Count**: Total transactions matching filters

### 💾 Export Functionality
- **CSV Export**: Download filtered transactions
- **Format**: Date, Type, Amount, Memo
- **Filename**: `activity-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

### 🎨 Visual Design
Each transaction type has a unique **color** and **icon**:
- 💚 Green: DEPOSIT, INCOME (money in)
- 💙 Blue: PAYROLL (salary)
- 💛 Yellow: FINE (penalties)
- 💜 Purple: PURCHASE (spending)
- 💗 Cyan: REFUND (money back)
- ❤️ Red: WITHDRAWAL, EXPENSE (money out)
- 🩶 Gray: TRANSFER, ADJUSTMENT (neutral)

## User Experience

### Dashboard Flow
1. Student logs in → sees dashboard
2. **Balance chart** at top shows trend visualization
3. Stats cards show key metrics (balance, rank, etc.)
4. **Activity widget** at bottom shows last 5 transactions
5. Filter dropdown lets them see specific types
6. "View All" button goes to full page

### Navigation Flow
1. Student clicks **"My Activity"** in sidebar (Quick Actions)
2. Opens dedicated activity page at `/classes/:classId/activity`
3. Sees complete transaction history with all tools

### Analysis Flow
1. Student wants to understand balance change
2. Opens Activity page
3. Uses filters to narrow down timeframe
4. Identifies specific transactions
5. Exports data for personal records

## Technical Details

### GraphQL Query
Uses existing `TRANSACTIONS_BY_ACCOUNT` query:
```graphql
query TransactionsByAccount($accountId: ID!) {
  transactionsByAccount(accountId: $accountId) {
    id
    type
    amount
    memo
    createdAt
  }
}
```

### Account ID Format
```typescript
accountId = `${userId}_${classId}`
```

### Balance Calculation
```typescript
// Current balance
const balance = transactions.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0)

// Balance over time (chronological)
let running = 0
transactions.forEach(t => {
  running += t.amount
  history.push({ date: t.createdAt, balance: running })
})
```

### Transaction Types Supported
```typescript
"DEPOSIT" | "WITHDRAWAL" | "TRANSFER" | "ADJUSTMENT" | 
"PURCHASE" | "REFUND" | "PAYROLL" | "FINE" | 
"INCOME" | "EXPENSE"
```

## Documentation

Two comprehensive guides created:
1. **STUDENT_ACTIVITY_SYSTEM.md** - Technical implementation details
