# üö® Railway Monorepo Setup - IMPORTANT

## The Problem You're Experiencing

Railway is trying to deploy from the **root directory** of your monorepo, but it can't determine which service to build because there's no package.json or Dockerfile at the root level.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

Railway requires you to create **separate services** for each part of your monorepo, each with its own **Root Directory** configuration.

---

## üéØ Correct Railway Setup Process

### Step 1: Create Railway Project

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Click **"Empty Project"** (don't use "Deploy from GitHub repo" directly)
4. Give your project a name (e.g., "ClassEcon")

### Step 2: Add Services One by One

You need to add **4 separate services** to your Railway project:

#### Service 1: Backend

1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Choose your `ClassEcon` repository
4. Click **"Add Service"**

**CRITICAL CONFIGURATION:**

1. Click on the service (it will be named after your repo)
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Under **"Source"** section, find **"Root Directory"**
4. Set it to: `Backend`
5. Under **"Build"** section:
   - Builder should auto-detect as **Docker**
   - If not, the `railway.toml` file will force it
6. Go to **Variables** tab and add environment variables (see below)
7. Go to **Settings** > **Networking** > **Generate Domain**

#### Service 2: Frontend

1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"** again
2. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Choose your `ClassEcon` repository again (yes, same repo!)
4. Click **"Add Service"**

**CRITICAL CONFIGURATION:**

1. Click on the new service
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Under **"Source"** section, find **"Root Directory"**
4. Set it to: `Frontend`
5. Builder should auto-detect as **Docker**
6. Go to **Variables** tab and add environment variables
7. Go to **Settings** > **Networking** > **Generate Domain**

#### Service 3: LandingPage

1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"** again
2. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Choose your `ClassEcon` repository again
4. Click **"Add Service"**

**CRITICAL CONFIGURATION:**

1. Click on the new service
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Under **"Source"** section, find **"Root Directory"**
4. Set it to: `LandingPage`
5. Builder should auto-detect as **Docker**
6. Go to **Variables** tab and add environment variables
7. Go to **Settings** > **Networking** > **Generate Domain**

#### Service 4: AuthService (Optional)

1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"** again
2. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Choose your `ClassEcon` repository again
4. Click **"Add Service"**

**CRITICAL CONFIGURATION:**

1. Click on the new service
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Under **"Source"** section, find **"Root Directory"**
4. Set it to: `AuthService`
5. Builder should auto-detect as **Docker**
6. Go to **Variables** tab and add environment variables
7. Go to **Settings** > **Networking** > **Generate Domain**

## üì∏ Visual Guide

Your Railway project should look like this:

```
ClassEcon Project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service: Backend (Root: Backend/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service: Frontend (Root: Frontend/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service: LandingPage (Root: LandingPage/)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Service: AuthService (Root: AuthService/)
```

Each service is built from the **same GitHub repository** but with a **different root directory**.

---

## üîß What the railway.toml Files Do

I've created `railway.toml` files in each service directory. These files:

1. **Tell Railway to use Docker** instead of trying to auto-detect
2. **Specify the Dockerfile path** (relative to the root directory)
3. **Configure health checks** for each service
4. **Set restart policies**

Railway will automatically detect and use these files.

## üéØ Step-by-Step Fix for Your Current Issue

### Option A: Start Fresh (Recommended)

1. **Delete your current Railway deployment**
2. **Create a new empty project** in Railway
3. **Follow the steps above** to add 4 separate services
4. **Set the Root Directory** for each service
5. **Add environment variables**
6. **Deploy**

### Option B: Fix Existing Service

If you already have a service created:

1. Click on the service in Railway
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Scroll to **"Source"** section
4. Find **"Root Directory"**
5. Enter one of: `Backend`, `Frontend`, `LandingPage`, or `AuthService`
6. Click **"Save"**
7. Go back and trigger a redeploy

## üìã Environment Variables Quick Reference

### Backend
```bash
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://...
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.railway.app,https://your-landing.railway.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.railway.app
LANDING_PAGE_URL=https://your-landing.railway.app
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=https://your-auth.railway.app
JWT_SECRET=<generate-with-openssl>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=15m
REFRESH_JWT_SECRET=<generate-with-openssl>
REFRESH_JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
SERVICE_API_KEY=<generate-with-openssl>
```

### Frontend
```bash
VITE_NODE_ENV=production
VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/graphql
VITE_GRAPHQL_HTTP_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/graphql
VITE_GRAPHQL_WS_URL=wss://your-backend.railway.app/graphql
VITE_LANDING_PAGE_URL=https://your-landing.railway.app

```

### LandingPage
```bash
VITE_NODE_ENV=production

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After setting up all services:

- [ ] 4 services created in Railway project
- [ ] Each service has correct Root Directory set
- [ ] Each service shows "Builder: Docker" in settings
- [ ] All environment variables added
- [ ] All services have generated domains
- [ ] All services deployed successfully

---

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Don't deploy from root** - Always set Root Directory
2. ‚ùå **Don't create 4 different Railway projects** - Create 1 project with 4 services
3. ‚ùå **Don't forget to set Root Directory** - This is the most critical step
4. ‚ùå **Don't skip railway.toml files** - They ensure Docker is used

---

## üéØ Quick Fix Command

If you need to recreate the railway.toml files:

```bash
# Already done! Files are created at:
# - Backend/railway.toml
# - Frontend/railway.toml
# - LandingPage/railway.toml
# - AuthService/railway.toml
```

3. Verify railway.toml exists in the directory
4. Verify Dockerfile exists in the directory
5. Try redeploying the service

## üéâ Summary

**The key issue**: Railway needs to know which directory to build from.

**The solution**: 
1. Create 4 separate services in ONE Railway project
2. Set Root Directory for each service
3. Railway will use the Dockerfile in each directory

**Files created**:
- ‚úÖ `Backend/railway.toml`
- ‚úÖ `Frontend/railway.toml`
- ‚úÖ `LandingPage/railway.toml`
- ‚úÖ `AuthService/railway.toml`

Now commit and push these files, then follow the setup process above!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway configuration files"
git push origin main
```

**Next**: Follow the step-by-step setup above to create your services correctly! üöÄ
