# Dashboard Enhancement & Salary System Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Automatic Salary Payment System ✅

#### Backend Changes:

**Installed Dependencies:**
- `node-cron` - For scheduling automated tasks
- `@types/node-cron` - TypeScript types

**New Files Created:**
- `Backend/src/services/salary.ts` - Complete salary payment automation system
  - `processSalaryPayments()` - Main function to process all due payments
  - `isPaymentDue()` - Checks if employment needs payment based on period
  - `processEmploymentPayment()` - Processes individual payment
  - `initSalaryCronJobs()` - Initializes cron jobs (runs daily at 9 AM + hourly checks)
  - `manualPayEmployment()` - Manual payment trigger for testing/admin

**Modified Files:**
- `Backend/src/index.ts` - Added `initSalaryCronJobs()` call on server startup
- `Backend/src/services/balance.ts` - Added `addToBalance()` helper function
- `Backend/src/utils/enums.ts` - Added `INCOME` and `EXPENSE` transaction types
- `Backend/src/schema.ts` - Added `INCOME` and `EXPENSE` to TransactionType enum
- `Backend/src/models/Transaction.ts` - Updated enum to include new types

**How Salary System Works:**
1. When a job application is approved, an Employment record is created with `startedAt` date
2. Cron jobs run:
   - Daily at 9 AM (main check)
   - Every hour (frequent check for testing)
3. For each active employment:
   - Checks if payment is due based on period (WEEKLY/BIWEEKLY/MONTHLY/SEMESTER)
   - Compares `lastPaidAt` (or `startedAt` if never paid) with current date
   - If due, creates:
     - Transaction record (type: "INCOME")
     - Updates `lastPaidAt` timestamp
4. Payment periods:
   - WEEKLY: Every 7 days
   - BIWEEKLY: Every 14 days
   - MONTHLY: First of each month
   - SEMESTER: Every ~5 months (150 days)

### 2. Bigger Icons ✅

**Modified Files:**
- `Frontend/src/modules/jobs/JobManagementPage.tsx`
  - Edit button: `h-4 w-4` → `h-5 w-5`
  - Delete button: `h-4 w-4` → `h-5 w-5`
  
- `Frontend/src/components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx`
  - Bell icon: `h-5 w-5` → `h-6 w-6`

### 3. Enhanced Teacher Dashboard Statistics ✅

#### Backend Changes:

**Schema Updates:**
- Added `classStatistics` query that returns `ClassStatistics` type
- `ClassStatistics` includes:
  - `totalStudents: Int!`
  - `totalJobs: Int!`
  - `activeJobs: Int!`
  - `totalEmployments: Int!`
  - `pendingApplications: Int!`
  - `totalTransactions: Int!`
  - `totalPayRequests: Int!`
  - `pendingPayRequests: Int!`
  - `averageBalance: Float!`
  - `totalCirculation: Float!`

**Resolver Implementation:**
- `Backend/src/resolvers/Query.ts` - Added `classStatistics` resolver
  - Aggregates data from Membership, Job, Employment, JobApplication, Transaction, PayRequest, and Account collections
  - Computes balance statistics from transactions using aggregation pipeline
  - Requires teacher authorization for the class

#### Frontend Changes:

**New Files:**
- `Frontend/src/graphql/queries/statistics.ts` - GraphQL query for class statistics

**Major Dashboard Overhaul:**
- `Frontend/src/modules/dashboard/TeacherDashboard.tsx` - Complete redesign

## Testing Recommendations

### Salary System:
1. Create a job with WEEKLY period
2. Approve a job application (creates employment)
3. Wait for cron to run (check backend logs)
4. Or trigger manually using `manualPayEmployment(employmentId)`
5. Verify Transaction and Account balance updates

### Dashboard:
1. Click "Edit Dashboard" button
2. Remove some widgets by clicking X
3. Click "Add Widget" to open dialog
4. Add widgets back
5. Click "Done" to exit edit mode
6. Click widgets to navigate to respective pages
7. Refresh page to verify localStorage persistence

## Notes

- Salary payments are automatic - no manual intervention needed after approval
- Dashboard customization is per-browser (localStorage)
- All widgets fetch live data from GraphQL
- Edit mode disables click-to-navigate to prevent accidental navigation
- Cron jobs log all activity to console for debugging

## Future Enhancements

1. Salary system notifications when payments are made
2. Payment history view for students
3. Manual payment override for teachers
4. Dashboard widgets for parents/students
5. Drag-and-drop widget reordering
6. Widget size customization
7. Export dashboard configuration
8. Server-side dashboard preferences (sync across devices)
