# üö® CRITICAL: Fix Beta Code Redirect Issue

## The Problem

Your Landing Page is redirecting to `localhost:5173` instead of the production Frontend URL.

**Root Cause:** Vite environment variables (`VITE_*`) are **embedded at build time**, not runtime. The current deployed build was created **before** you set `VITE_FRONTEND_URL` in Railway.

## Current Configuration

‚úÖ **Environment variable is set correctly in Railway:**
```json
{
  "VITE_FRONTEND_URL": "https://classecon-production-aeea.up.railway.app/"
}
```

‚ùå **But the deployed build doesn't have it** - needs rebuild!

## ‚úÖ Solution: Trigger a New Deployment

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy (Fastest)

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click on **LandingPage** service
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
5. Wait for build to complete

### Option 2: Push a Dummy Commit

```bash
cd LandingPage
echo "# Force rebuild" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger rebuild to embed VITE_FRONTEND_URL"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically redeploy.

### Option 3: Use Railway CLI

```bash
railway up --service landing-page
```

## üîç How to Verify It's Fixed

After the new deployment completes:

### 1. Check the Build Logs

Look for the build logs in Railway. The environment variable should be embedded during the Vite build process.

### 2. Open Browser Console

1. Go to your Landing Page: `https://classecon-production.up.railway.app/`
2. Click "Get Early Access"
3. Enter a valid beta code
4. **Open browser console** (F12)
5. Look for this log:

```
üìù Environment check: {
  VITE_FRONTEND_URL: "https://classecon-production-aeea.up.railway.app",  // Should NOT be undefined!
  VITE_NODE_ENV: "production",
  hostname: "classecon-production.up.railway.app"
}
```

### 3. Test the Redirect

If `VITE_FRONTEND_URL` is properly set, you'll see:
```
üîó Redirecting to frontend: https://classecon-production-aeea.up.railway.app
```

Then it will redirect to the Frontend's `/auth` page.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Still Not Working

### Problem: Environment Variable Not Embedded

**Check:**
```bash
# In Railway logs, search for "VITE_FRONTEND_URL" during build
```

**If not found during build:**
1. Verify the variable name is exactly `VITE_FRONTEND_URL` (case-sensitive)
2. Verify it's set in the **LandingPage** service (not Frontend)
3. Try deleting and re-adding the variable
4. Redeploy again

### Problem: Shows Error Message

If the beta modal shows "Configuration error. Please contact support.":
- `VITE_FRONTEND_URL` is still not embedded
- Check browser console for: `‚ùå VITE_FRONTEND_URL is not set!`
- This confirms the build doesn't have the variable
- Redeploy LandingPage service

## üìù Code Changes Made

The new code:
1. ‚úÖ **Explicitly requires** `VITE_FRONTEND_URL` in production
2. ‚úÖ **Shows error** if missing instead of silently failing to localhost
3. ‚úÖ **Adds detailed logging** to debug environment variables
4. ‚úÖ **Only uses localhost fallback** in local development

## üéØ Summary

**What you need to do RIGHT NOW:**

1. ‚úÖ Environment variable is set correctly - **DONE**
2. ‚úÖ Code is updated with better error handling - **DONE** (just pushed)
3. ‚è≥ **REDEPLOY Landing Page** - **DO THIS NOW**
4. ‚è≥ Test beta code redirect
5. ‚è≥ Check browser console for environment logs

---

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Issue:** Beta code redirects to localhost instead of production Frontend  
**Cause:** Old build without VITE_FRONTEND_URL embedded  
**Fix:** Redeploy Landing Page to rebuild with environment variable
