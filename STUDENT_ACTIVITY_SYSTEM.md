# Student Activity System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Replaced the "My Fines" widget with a comprehensive "My Activity" system that shows all transaction history with filtering capabilities, balance visualization, and historical analysis.

## Changes Summary

### 1. New Components Created

#### `StudentActivityWidget.tsx`
**Location**: `Frontend/src/components/activity/StudentActivityWidget.tsx`

**Purpose**: Replaces the StudentFinesWidget on the dashboard with a general activity widget

**Features**:
- Displays recent transactions (last 5)
- Filter by transaction type (all, deposits, income, payroll, purchases, fines, refunds, expenses)
- Visual categorization with icons and colors for each transaction type
- Statistics: Total Income and Total Expenses
- "View All" button navigating to full activity page
- Real-time updates via GraphQL

**Transaction Types Supported**:
- DEPOSIT (green) - Deposits
- INCOME (green) - General income
- PAYROLL (blue) - Salary payments
- REFUND (cyan) - Refunds
- PURCHASE (purple) - Store purchases
- FINE (yellow) - Fines applied
- WITHDRAWAL (red) - Withdrawals
- EXPENSE (red) - Expenses
- TRANSFER (gray) - Transfers
- ADJUSTMENT (gray) - Balance adjustments

#### `BalanceOverTimeChart.tsx`
**Location**: `Frontend/src/components/activity/BalanceOverTimeChart.tsx`

**Purpose**: Visualizes balance history over time with an SVG chart

**Features**:
- Line chart showing balance progression
- Area fill under the line for visual emphasis
- Grid lines with balance labels
- Zero line indicator (if balance goes negative)
- Statistics display:
  - Highest balance reached
  - Lowest balance (including negatives)
  - Total transaction count
  - Current balance with change indicator
- Responsive SVG rendering
- Automatic scaling based on data range

#### `MyActivityPage.tsx`
**Location**: `Frontend/src/modules/activity/MyActivityPage.tsx`

**Purpose**: Full-page view for complete transaction history

**Features**:
- Balance over time chart at the top
- Comprehensive statistics cards:
  - Total Income
  - Total Expenses
  - Net Change
  - Transaction Count
- Advanced filtering:
  - By transaction type (dropdown)
  - By date range (all time, this month, last month, last 3 months)
  - By search query (searches memo and type)
- Export to CSV functionality
- Complete transaction list with:
  - Visual categorization
  - Full details (type, amount, memo, timestamp)
  - Color-coded amounts (green for positive, red for negative)
- Real-time filter count display

### 2. Modified Components

#### `StudentDashboard.tsx`
**Location**: `Frontend/src/modules/dashboard/StudentDashboard.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed import of `StudentFinesWidget`
- Added imports for `StudentActivityWidget` and `BalanceOverTimeChart`
- Added `accountId` calculation: `${user.id}_${currentClassId}`
- Added `BalanceOverTimeChart` component at top of dashboard (after header, before stats)
- Replaced `StudentFinesWidget` section with `StudentActivityWidget` at bottom

**Result**: Dashboard now shows balance graph first, then stats, then activity widget

#### `StudentLayout.tsx`
**Location**: `Frontend/src/modules/layout/StudentLayout.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed `AlertTriangle` icon import
- Added `Clock` icon import
- Removed `FINES_BY_STUDENT` GraphQL query import
- Removed fines query execution and `activeFinesCount` calculation
- Replaced "My Fines" navigation link with "My Activity" link
- Updated link route to: `/classes/${currentClassId}/activity`
- Changed icon from `AlertTriangle` to `Clock`
- Removed badge showing active fines count

**Result**: Cleaner navigation focused on activity tracking instead of fines

### 3. Routing Updates

#### `main.tsx`
**Location**: `Frontend/src/main.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `MyActivityPage`
- Added new route: `{ path: "classes/:classId/activity", element: <MyActivityPage /> }`

**Route Structure**:
```
/classes/:classId/activity - My Activity page (available to all students)
```

## GraphQL Queries Used

### Existing Query
- **`TRANSACTIONS_BY_ACCOUNT`** (`Frontend/src/graphql/queries/accounts.ts`)
  - Fetches all transactions for a student's account
  - Fields: `id`, `type`, `amount`, `memo`, `createdAt`
  - Used by all three new components

## User Experience Flow

### From Dashboard
1. Student sees balance graph at top showing historical progression
2. Stats cards show balance, rank, pending requests, affordable items
3. Activity widget at bottom shows last 5 transactions with filter dropdown
4. Click "View All Transactions" to go to full activity page

### From Navigation
1. Student clicks "My Activity" in sidebar Quick Actions
2. Navigates to `/classes/:classId/activity`
3. Full page view with comprehensive filtering

### On Activity Page
1. Balance over time chart shows complete history
2. Stats cards summarize income, expenses, net change
3. Filter panel allows:
   - Type filtering (dropdown with all transaction types)
   - Date range filtering (all time, this month, last month, last 3 months)
   - Text search (searches memo and type fields)
4. Transaction list shows all matching transactions
5. Export button downloads filtered data as CSV

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **Account ID**: Calculated as `${userId}_${classId}` in components
2. **GraphQL Query**: `TRANSACTIONS_BY_ACCOUNT(accountId: ID!)`
3. **Sorting**: Transactions sorted by date descending (newest first)
4. **Filtering**: Client-side filtering by type, date range, and search query
5. **Calculations**: Running balance calculated from transaction amounts

### Balance Calculation
```typescript
// Current balance
const currentBalance = transactions.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0);

// Balance history (chronological)
let runningBalance = 0;
transactions.forEach(txn => {
  runningBalance += txn.amount;
  history.push({ date: txn.createdAt, balance: runningBalance });
});
```

### CSV Export
- Headers: Date, Type, Amount, Memo
- Format: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, TYPE, 123.45, "memo text"`
- Downloads as: `activity-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

## Styling & Design

### Color Scheme by Transaction Type
- **Green**: Income-related (DEPOSIT, INCOME)
- **Blue**: Payroll
- **Cyan**: Refunds
- **Purple**: Purchases
- **Yellow**: Fines
- **Red**: Expenses/Withdrawals
- **Gray**: Transfers/Adjustments

### Icons
- Each transaction type has a distinct icon
- Balance chart uses TrendingUp/TrendingDown for changes
- Activity uses Clock icon in navigation

### Responsive Design
- Chart scales properly on all screen sizes
- Transaction cards stack nicely on mobile
- Filter panel uses grid layout on desktop, stacks on mobile
- SVG chart uses viewBox for proper scaling

## Benefits Over Previous System

### Before (Fines Widget)
- Only showed fine-related activity
- Limited to 3 recent fines
- Basic statistics (active fines, total fined)
- No historical view
- Navigation to generic "profile" page

### After (Activity System)
- Shows ALL transaction types
- Displays last 5 transactions (configurable)
- Comprehensive statistics (income, expenses, net change)
- Full historical view with balance chart
- Dedicated activity page with advanced filtering
- CSV export for record-keeping
- Better financial literacy through visualization

## Migration Notes

### For Users
- Fines are still tracked (as FINE transaction type)
- All previous fine data appears in activity history
- No data loss - just better organization

### For Developers
- `StudentFinesWidget` component can be deprecated
- `FINES_BY_STUDENT` query still used by teacher views
- Activity system is additive, doesn't remove fine functionality
- Fine management page still exists for teachers at `/classes/:classId/fines`

## Conclusion

The activity system provides a comprehensive financial tracking experience for students, replacing the limited fines widget with a full-featured transaction history viewer. Students can now see their complete financial activity, understand their balance changes over time, and export data for their records. The system maintains all fine functionality while presenting it as part of a broader financial tracking system.
