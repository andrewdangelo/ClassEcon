### 2. Balance System
Fines automatically affect student balance:
- Issued fine → Balance decreases
- Waived fine → Balance increases (refund)

### 3. Notification System
Students receive notifications:
- "Fine Issued" - when fined
- "Fine Waived" - when fine is waived

### 4. Transaction History
Fines appear in transaction history:
- Students can see all fine transactions
- Teachers can track financial impact
