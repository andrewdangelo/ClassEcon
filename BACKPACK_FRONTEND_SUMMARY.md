## Date: January 2025

## Overview
Completed the full frontend implementation for the backpack and redemption system, building on top of the backend infrastructure. This includes student backpack UI, teacher redemption management, and notification integration.

---

## 1. GraphQL Operations Created

### Queries (`Frontend/src/graphql/queries/backpack.ts`)

1. **STUDENT_BACKPACK** - Get student's backpack items
   - Variables: `studentId`, `classId`
   - Returns: Array of Purchase items with status "in-backpack"
   - Fields: Purchase details + nested StoreItem

2. **PURCHASE_HISTORY** - Get complete purchase history
   - Variables: `studentId`, `classId`
   - Returns: All purchases (all statuses)
   - Fields: Same as STUDENT_BACKPACK

3. **REDEMPTION_REQUESTS** - Get redemption requests for class
   - Variables: `classId`, `status` (optional filter)
   - Returns: Array of RedemptionRequest with nested Purchase, Student, ReviewedBy
   - Used by teachers to manage requests

4. **REDEMPTION_REQUEST** - Get single redemption request
   - Variables: `id`
   - Returns: Single RedemptionRequest with full details

### Mutations (`Frontend/src/graphql/mutations/redemption.ts`)

1. **CREATE_REDEMPTION_REQUEST** - Student submits redemption request
   - Variables: `purchaseId`, `studentNote` (optional)
   - Triggers notification to all class teachers

2. **APPROVE_REDEMPTION** - Teacher approves redemption
   - Variables: `id`, `teacherComment`

   - Variables: `id`, `teacherComment`
   - Purchase stays in backpack (status: "in-backpack")
   - Triggers notification to student

## 2. Frontend Components Created

### A. Student Backpack Component
**File:** `Frontend/src/components/backpack/BackpackSidebar.tsx`

**Purpose:** Displays student's purchased items and allows redemption requests

- Shows item image, title, description, quantity, price
- "Request Redemption" button for each item
- Dialog modal for optional student note

**State Management:**
- Apollo Client for GraphQL queries/mutations
- Local state for dialog and note input
- Refetches on successful submission

**Integration:**
- Added to `Sidebar.tsx` below navigation for STUDENT role only
- Appears in border-separated section
- Uses current class context

### B. Teacher Redemption Management Page
**File:** `Frontend/src/modules/requests/RedemptionRequestsPage.tsx`

**Features:**
- Tabbed interface: Pending / Approved / Denied / All
- Badge counters for each status
- Card grid layout with request details:
  - Student name
  - Item image and title

## 3. Backend Notification Integration

### Updated: `Backend/src/services/notifications.ts`

Added **createRedemptionNotification** function with 3 workflow states:

1. **submitted** - Notifies all class teachers
   - Type: `REDEMPTION_SUBMITTED`
   - Title: "New Redemption Request"
   - Message: "A student wants to redeem: {itemTitle}"

2. **approved** - Notifies student
   - Type: `REDEMPTION_APPROVED`
   - Title: "Redemption Approved"
   - Message: "Your redemption request for '{itemTitle}' has been approved"

3. **denied** - Notifies student
   - Type: `REDEMPTION_DENIED`
   - Title: "Redemption Denied"
   - Message: "Your redemption request for '{itemTitle}' has been denied"

### Updated: `Backend/src/resolvers/Mutation.ts`

Integrated notifications into redemption mutations:

1. **createRedemptionRequest**
   - Fetches storeItem and teacher IDs
   - Calls `createRedemptionNotification(..., "submitted")`

2. **approveRedemption**
   - Fetches storeItem
   - Updates Purchase status to "redeemed"
   - Calls `createRedemptionNotification(..., "approved")`

3. **denyRedemption**
   - Fetches storeItem
   - Calls `createRedemptionNotification(..., "denied")`

---

## 4. Routing & Navigation

### Added Routes (`Frontend/src/main.tsx`)

```tsx
{ 
  path: "redemptions", 
  element: (
    <RequireTeacher>
      <RedemptionRequestsPage />
    </RequireTeacher>
  ) 
}
```

### Updated Sidebar Navigation (`Frontend/src/components/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`)

Added new nav item for teachers:
- Label: "Redemptions"
- Icon: Package
- Route: `/redemptions`
- Roles: `["TEACHER"]` only

---

## 5. Data Flow

### Student Workflow
1. Student purchases item from store → creates Purchase (status: "in-backpack")
2. Item appears in BackpackSidebar
3. Student clicks "Request Redemption" → opens dialog
4. Student adds optional note → submits
5. CREATE_REDEMPTION_REQUEST mutation runs
6. Teachers receive notification
7. Student sees confirmation

### Teacher Workflow
1. Teacher receives notification of new redemption request
2. Teacher navigates to /redemptions page
3. Sees pending request with student details, item, note
4. Clicks Approve or Deny → opens dialog
5. Teacher adds required comment → submits
6. APPROVE_REDEMPTION or DENY_REDEMPTION mutation runs
7. Student receives notification
8. Purchase status updates (if approved)

### Notification Flow
```
Student submits → All teachers notified (REDEMPTION_SUBMITTED)
Teacher approves → Student notified (REDEMPTION_APPROVED)
Teacher denies → Student notified (REDEMPTION_DENIED)
```

## 6. UI/UX Enhancements

### Student Backpack
- Compact sidebar design (fits below navigation)
- Visual empty state with icon
- Item cards with images
- Badge showing item count
- Clear call-to-action buttons

### Teacher Redemption Page
- Full-page layout with header
- Status tabs with counts
- Grid layout responsive to screen size
- Color-coded status badges:
  - Pending: Secondary (gray)
  - Approved: Default (blue/primary)
  - Denied: Destructive (red)
- Status icons: Clock, CheckCircle, XCircle
- Two-button action layout (approve/deny)
- Required comment ensures accountability

---

## 7. Technical Implementation Details

### Apollo Client Integration
- Uses `useQuery` with `cache-and-network` policy
- `refetchQueries` on mutations to update UI
- Skip queries when dependencies missing (no user/class)
- Type-safe with generated TypeScript types

### Error Handling
- Console logging for debugging
- Error state displays for failed queries
- Disabled buttons during submission
- Form validation (required comment)

### Performance Considerations
- Queries skip execution when no class selected
- Refetch only necessary queries after mutations
- Images lazy-loaded in cards
- Efficient filtering with GraphQL variables

## Summary

The frontend implementation is complete and fully integrated with the backend. Students can view their backpack, submit redemption requests, and receive notifications. Teachers can review requests, approve or deny them, and add comments. All actions trigger appropriate notifications through the existing notification system.

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns, uses Apollo Client best practices, and provides a clean, intuitive UI for both student and teacher workflows.
